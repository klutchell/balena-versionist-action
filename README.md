# balena versionist GitHub action

Automatic versioning of source files with [balena-versionist](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-versionist).

Useful as a first step in continuous deployment workflows.

The following actions are taken sequentially:

1. Run `balena-versionist`. This will update a number of files depending on the detected project type.
2. Add a new commit to the working branch with the versioned changes.
3. Create a release tag corresponding to the new version.
4. Upload a compressed artifact of the versioned source.
5. Push changes and tags to the default branch on merge.
